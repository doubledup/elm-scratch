# Elm scratch

Small Elm apps for learning the language. Includes some of the code from the
official [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) for comparison.

## Running

As normal, either compile individual files with `elm make src/Main.elm` and
open the generated `index.html` with a browser, or start up `elm reactor` and
point your browser at `localhost:8000`
